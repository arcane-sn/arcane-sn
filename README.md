# 👋 Hi, I’m Ezra Senaputra

I’m a passionate **Software Engineer** with 3+ years of experience mainly on Frontend Development, always eager to learn and want contribute to the open-source community. 
I specialize in building efficient, scalable web applications using a wide range of technologies.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning...
- **Vue.js** (still learning, but excited about it!)
- **Go** (exploring new horizons)
- **Java Spring Boot** (backend development)

## 👀 I’m interested in...
- Contributing to open-source libraries for the community
- Developing private libraries like debounce, outside click, and others
- Building high-quality, maintainable code with **Next.js**, **React.js**, **Express.js**, and **Nest.js**
- Exploring the world of **React Native** for mobile app development

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools
- **Frontend**: React.js, Next.js, Vue.js, React Native, TypeScript, JavaScript

## ⚡ Fun fact: 
- I’m **DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH COFFEE**, even though I have GERD – nothing can stop me from enjoying my favorite brew! ☕️
